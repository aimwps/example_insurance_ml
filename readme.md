# EXAMPLE INSURANCE MACHINE LEARNING

This machine learning application works in tandom with thie insurance_api respository found here... https://github.com/aimwps/example_insurance_api
This is an example project of how a web application can utilse data from an API to train machine learning models. 


## THE DATA
As this is a quick example I will use a single and limited dataset to predict insurance premium costs based on user data. In a production
environment there will be far greater complexities to the data being stored, and therefore how it can be utilised.
